class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The AIRTOOLS software - or <strong>A</strong>stronomical
<strong>I</strong>mage <strong>R</strong>eduction
<strong>TOOLS</strong>et - has been developed for the purpose of
calibrating and analyzing images of astronomical objects captured by CCD
or DSLR cameras. The software provides a large number of functions for
basic image calibration (e.g. bias-, dark-, flatfield calibration, raw
development of bayered images), for automated object recognition,
registration and stacking as well as automated astrometric and
photometric calibration routines.</p>
<p>Moreover specialized tools have been developed to process comet
observations and measure the total coma brightness at an accuracy
similar to that of visual observers or better. The invention of “Large
Aperture Photometry” should allow to complement visual observations,
extending to fainter magnitude limits (due to long exposures) with
additional benefits of being independent from the observer and added
reproducibility of measurement results.</p>
<p>Recently a graphical user interface has been added to make the
software more user friendly. It tries to derive suitable parameters for
the underlying functions and programs to hide as much complexity as
possible from the average user. Internally a large number of open source
software programs for image analysis and visualization is used,
e.g. <em>ImageMagick</em>, <em>GraphicsMagick</em>, <em>Netpbm</em> und
<em>Gnuplot</em>. Powerful and extremely versatile tools well known in
the professional area of astronomical image reduction are used as well,
e.g.</p>

<p>The AIRTOOLS software is freely available. The project - including
source code - is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/ewelot/airtools"
class="uri">https://github.com/ewelot/airtools</a>. Pre-compiled binary
packages are provided for a few Linux distributions. Users of other
operating systems can use the software in a virtualized environment.</p>
<p>The AIRTOOLS software has been developed in the hope to proove
useful. Its development relies on your feedback, so please do not
hesitate to ask any question, e.g. by contacting the author by e-mail at
<a href="mailto:t.lehmann@mailbox.org"
class="email">t.lehmann@mailbox.org</a>. As well, any suggestion or
comment is welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good luck and clear skies!</p>
<p>Thomas Lehmann, Weimar (Germany)</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="installation"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Installation</h1>
<p>The AIRTOOLS software is running on a Linux operating system, which
is not commonly used in the amateur astronomy community. Nevertheless
there exist well established solutions to use the software in a
virtualized computer environment on Windows (or any other operating
sytem).</p>
<p>The installation procedure therefore depends on the host operating
system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Installation on a supported Linux distribution, which is as
simple as adding the AIRTOOLS binary package repository to your
system</p></li>
<li><p>Installation on a Windows computer (or OS/X or any non-supported
Linux distribution) by first installing a virtualization software and
then importing a ready to use appliance containing a Linux system with
pre-installed AIRTOOLS software (approximately 10 minutes of
work)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another more elaborated custom installation on Windows can be done by
first installing a virtualization software and then installing a custom
virtual Linux operating system and finally installing the AIRTOOLS
software within this Linux OS. This procedure is recommended for more
advanced users only and described in detail in the appendix.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="installation-on-linux"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Installation on Linux</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.1.1" id="installing-the-airtools-software"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Installing the AIRTOOLS
software</h3>
<p>The AIRTOOLS project is hosted at <a
href="https://github.com/ewelot/airtools"
class="uri">https://github.com/ewelot/airtools</a> where you can find
the latest source code and documentation. Pre-compiled binary packages
are build for several Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04 “Focal”</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 “Jammy”</li>
<li>Debian 11 “Bullseye”</li>
<li>Debian 12 “Bookworm”</li>
</ul>
<p>Development is done using a recent Debian Linux distribution. Ubuntu
packages are tested on Xubuntu LTS distributions and should work on any
Ubuntu desktop flavour (e.g. native Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu) or other
derivatives like LinuxMint.</p>
<p>Adding the binary package repository of the AIRTOOLS software is done
by adding an entry to the package managment sources list. This can be
accomplished by running the following commands in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code># download and verify key:
SRCREPO=https://github.com/ewelot/airtools
wget -O airtools.asc $SRCREPO/raw/master/airtools.asc
md5sum airtools.asc
# which must show: 8b2a22750d677bd92a2ff456160e6b2e

# convert and register the key:
KEY=/usr/share/keyrings/airtools.gpg
sudo gpg --yes --output $KEY --dearmor airtools.asc

# add the package repository
DIST=$(lsb_release -s -c)
PKGREPO=http://fg-kometen.vdsastro.de/airtools/debian
SRCFILE=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/airtools.list
sudo bash -c &quot;echo deb [signed-by=$KEY] $PKGREPO $DIST main &gt; $SRCFILE&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The software installation is done by invoking the following
commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install airtools</code></pre>
<p>Upon first installation of the AIRTOOLS software the script will
download many other required software packages from the official
distribution repository. This might take several minutes depending on
the bandwidth of your internet connection. At the end of the
installation a new shortcut icon is showing up on your Linux
desktop.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.2" id="updating-the-airtools-software"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Updating the AIRTOOLS
software</h3>
<p>The AIRTOOLS software is updated every couple of months. If the
binary package repository has been added already (see previous section)
then you can install an update by issuing the following two
commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install airtools</code></pre>
<h3 data-number="2.1.3" id="uninstalling-the-airtools-software"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Uninstalling the AIRTOOLS

<h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="installing-oracle-virtualbox"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Installing Oracle
VirtualBox</h3>
<p>VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org"
class="uri">http://www.virtualbox.org</a>) is a free and powerful
virtualization software for enterprise and home users. Get the software
appropriate for your host operating system from the <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Downloads</a> page and
install it.</p>
<p>You must also download and install the “Oracle VM VirtualBox
Extension Pack” for improved performance and additional virtual hardware
features. Get it from the appropriate section of the previously
mentioned download page. Click on “All supported platforms” and open it
using the Oracle VM VirtualBox software.</p>
<p>In the following chapters the physical computer where you have
installed the VirtualBox software is sometimes refered to as “host”
computer. A virtual computer managed by the VirtualBox software is
called a virtual machine or simply “guest” computer.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.2" id="importing-the-linuxairtools-appliance"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Importing the Linux/AIRTOOLS
appliance</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Download the <a
href="https://fg-kometen.vdsastro.de/airtools/vm/xubuntu-airtools.ova">Xubuntu
Linux/AIRTOOLS appliance</a></p></li>
<li><p>Start the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, choose File/Import
Appliance and select the local .ova file</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure there is sufficient free disk space in the virtual
machine base folder on your host computer. The .ova file size is only
2.5 GB and will expand to about 8 GB after importing. The virtual disk
file will grow from this initial size (containing the Linux OS, AIRTOOLS
and all required software compnents) dynamically up to its maximum size
of 100 GB upon using the virtual guest system. Therefore you should make
sure that you have at least that much of free disk space.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual machine settings were choosen to impose low hardware
requirements: it uses 3 CPU cores and 4 GB of physical RAM only. This is
sufficient to run the AIRTOOLS software even on large images (e.g. 30
Mpix single band images). It is possible to adjust those settings at any
time later on within the Oracle VirtualBox Manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Start importing the appliance by clicking the button
“Import”.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="2.2.3" id="starting-the-virtual-linux-os"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Starting the virtual Linux
OS</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You are now ready to “boot” the virtual Linux computer from the
VirtualBox Manager or create a desktop shortcut (see pop-up menu when
right-clicking on the machine name) and start from there. It will
automatically login to the Xubuntu desktop with the user name “user”
(password is “user” as well).</p></li>
<li><p>There might be messages written at the top of the window (about
mouse integration and alike) which you can savely ignore.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="2.2.4" id="xubuntu-desktop-basics"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Xubuntu Desktop Basics</h3>
<p>The desktop of the virtual Linux computer is displayed within the
window of the Oracle VM VirtualBox software. The menu bar at the top is
part of the virtualization software. The Xubuntu Linux desktop is
located directly below this menu bar.</p>
<p>On the top of the desktop screen there is a (dark) desktop panel. If
you click on the small icon on the left of this panel (it uses the
Xubuntu logo which mimics the head of a mouse) the main application menu
pops up. From there you can start programs, tweak several desktop
settings, log out and shutdown the virtual Linux system. Note the
location of the “Log out” icon at bottom-right of the menu, which is
also used to shutdown or restart the Linux OS. Get familiar with how to
start the web browser and the file manager and how to shutdown the Linux
OS.</p>
<p>You might need to adjust the keyboard language. This is done by
clicking the appropriate panel applet with the name “EN” and choosing an
item from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>For additional information please consult the official <a
href="https://docs.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu Documentation</a> or other
tutorials on the web. Please keep in mind that you do not have to worry
about any hardware specific setups in your Linux system (or for example
network connection) because all communication to the real devices of the
host computer is transparently handled by the VirtualBox drivers.</p>

Interface</h1>
<p>The graphical user interface consists of a top menu bar, three main
tabs and a text area for log output.</p>
<p>TODO: description of main menu bar items</p>
<p>Main processing tasks are organized in three different tabs. The
first tab provides access to all basic image reduction steps to process
raw images with the goal to finally create stacked images of your
targets. The second tab is dedicated to the comet extraction and large
aperture photometry tasks. Finally, a couple of handy tools are placed
on a third tab.</p>

</figure>
<p>The lower part of the interface will display text output from any
processing steps. There you can watch progress of the running tasks, see
some measurement results but also possible error messages. In a few
cases during the comet extraction part you will get information about a
required user action written to the same text area. Please note that all
the visible output is also logged to a text file
<code>airtools.log</code> in the project directory for later
reference.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.1" id="what-is-a-project"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> What is a Project?</h2>
<p>When observing during a clear night, many different exposures are
taken, usually of different targets. It is common practice that an
observation of a single target consists of multiple bracketed exposures.
Serious observers are capturing calibration frames (darks, flats) as
well. It is possible that different instruments (telescopes, filters,
cameras) are used. All these images of a single night will be processed
in a single AIRTOOLS project. Consequently, the project directory itself
(and related ones) should have the date of observation used as part of
its name. It is good practice to use the date at the beginning of the
night.</p>
<p>The following directories are related to a project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project directory:<br />
It stores all config files of this project, results from image reduction
and analysis (images, plots, data tables) and log files. After finishing
a project this directory should be saved, e.g. to an external disk
drive.</li>
<li>Raw directory:<br />
Used for all the individual raw images as created by your image
asquisition system, both light frames and calibration images related to
the project.</li>
<li>Temporary directory:<br />
Used to store individual calibrated images of the project which are used
by several different AIRTOOLS analysis tasks as well as temporary files
created during those tasks. This directory may be savely deleted when
the project is finished.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="setting-up-the-airtools-software"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Setting up the AIRTOOLS
software</h2>
<p>Upon first start of the AIRTOOLS software a few settings have to be
defined. All projects use a common base for their project directories.
Each project will create a subdirectory below this path. Similarly, the
base location for raw files directories of any project and for all
temporary directories has to be choosen. Note that the vast majority of
disk space will be used on the temporary directories.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="setting-up-the-first-project"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Setting up the first
Project</h2>
<p>You may try the AIRTOOLS software using sample data. If you just want
to get up and running quickly you could follow the instructions provided
in the <a href="#sample-data-project">appendix</a> and skip the rest of
chapter 4.</p>
<p>For any new project the setup form has to be completed. Select the
date of observation. This will be used to make initial suggestions for
path names of the project directory, raw directory and temporary
directory. It is allowed to modify those names, e.g. append a letter.
E.g. you might want to repeat the image reduction of a given night using
other parameters without interfering the original analysis. In that case
you could use the same raw directory name but different names for the
project and temporary directories for a second project.</p>
<p>Further settings are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Observatory Site:</dt>
<dd>
Enter the name of your observatory site (must be single word) or choose
one of the items from the combobox dropdown list (it holds items which
are already defined in the parameter file <code>sites.dat</code>).
</dd>
<dt>Offset of Camera Time:</dt>
<dd>
Enter the time offset of your camera time with respect to UT in hours.
The camera time is found either in RAW images metadata of DSLR cameras
or in the header of your FITS images (usually stored in keyword
DATE-OBS).
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Optional settings for observer details are used by reports of
photometric or astrometrc measurements generated by AIRTOOLS for
submission to COBS or MPC:</p>
<dl>

<h2 data-number="4.4" id="parameter-files"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Parameter Files</h2>
<p>The different image acquisition systems used by amateurs do normally
write some meta data about telescope, camera etc. to image headers.
Those data are required by any image reduction and analysis software.
Unfortunately, keyword names and the format of their values is not
standardized in any way.</p>
<p>We therefore decided to supply most redundant data by means of
parameter files - simple text files, structured in a tabular way. The
first line in the file is used to name the columns (parameters).
Anything that appears after the <code>#</code> sign in any other line is
considered a comment and will be ignored. Each line describes a separate
entry and each parameter value is made of a single word. In some places
you are allowed to use the character <code>-</code> to indicate an
unknown value.</p>
<p>At first the information about your observatory site must be added to
the corresponding parameter file <code>sites.dat</code>. From the
AIRTOOLS application’s “Edit” menu select “Edit Site Parameters”. This
will start a simple text editor (called <em>mousepad</em>). The
parameter file should have a few entries already, which can be used as
reference when adding a new line for your site. The column description
is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>ID:</dt>
<dd>
This is a unique short identifier for your site (three letters)
</dd>
<dt>COD:</dt>
<dd>
Three digit observatory code (IAU code or MPC code) published by the MPC
</dd>
<dt>location:</dt>
<dd>
A unique single word for the name of your observatory location. The
previously used entry of the observatory site during project setup must
match one of these.
</dd>
<dt>long:</dt>
<dd>
Geographic longitude in degrees, negative for a location east of
Greenwich meridian.
</dd>
<dt>lat:</dt>
<dd>
Geographic latitude in degrees, negative for a locations south of the
equator.
</dd>
<dt>alt:</dt>
<dd>
Altitude of your observatory in meters.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Save your edits and close the text editor.</p>
<p>The next information you have to provide is those of the
instrumentation you have used. Open the parameter file
<code>camera.dat</code> by selecting “Edit” and “Edit Camera
Parameters”. Each combination of telescope and camera must have a
dedicated entry. Use the existing sample entries as a reference for your
newly added lines. The columns used are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>tel:</dt>
<dd>
Unique identifier for the telescope and camera, using 3-6 alphanumeric
characters.
</dd>
<dt>flen:</dt>
<dd>
Focal length of the telescope or camera lens in mm.
</dd>
<dt>aperture:</dt>
<dd>
Open aperture of the telescope or camera lens in mm.
</dd>
<dt>fratio:</dt>
<dd>
F-ration of the telescope or camera, that is <code>flen/aperture</code>.
</dd>
<dt>camera:</dt>
<dd>
Camera model, used for your convenience only
</dd>
<dt>camchip:</dt>
<dd>
Camera and sensor keys used in final ICQ records of a comet measurement.
Refer to the lists of <a
href="https://cobs.si/help/icq_list/list_camera_types/">camera keys</a>
and <a href="https://cobs.si/help/icq_list/list_chip_types/">sensor
keys</a>. Both values have to be provided in a single word, using the
character <code>/</code> as a delimiter. If you for example have used a
Canon 6D DSLR for imaging then the correct entry would be
<code>CDS/CFC</code>.
</dd>
<dt>flip:</dt>
<dd>
Indicate if the image data is flipped top-down (1) or not (0).
Essentially this describes the order and interpretation of FITS data: If
the FITS file is organized in such a way that the data of the bottom
image row comes first and that of the top-most row latest then it is
considered unflipped and the other way it is flipped. More information
about checking the image orientation is provided in chapter 4.5.
</dd>
<dt>rot:</dt>
<dd>
Camera rotation with respect to the sky coordinate system. This
parameter is left for historical reason but not used in current versions
of the software and should be left undefined (using the string “-”).
</dd>
<dt>rawbits:</dt>
<dd>
Original bitdepth or number of bits per pixel in a single color channel.
Note that at start of the image reduction the counts (ADU, intensities)
are scaled up to the 16-bit range where needed.
</dd>
<dt>satur:</dt>
<dd>
Saturation value. Strictly speeking the upper counts (ADU) for which the
camera response is linear (proportional to the illumination intensity)
must be provided. We need the value after scaling up to the 16-bit
range, e.g. if you are using a consumer DSLR where response is linear up
to 2/3 of its dynamic range then you should enter a value of 40000
approximately.
</dd>
<dt>gain:</dt>
<dd>
Number of electrons per ADU. Use a value of 1 if it is not known.
</dd>
<dt>pixscale:</dt>
<dd>
Approximate value of the size of a (unbinned) pixel on the sky in
seconds of arc.
</dd>
<dt>magzero:</dt>
<dd>
Zeropoint of the non-calibrated instrumental magnitude scale. This is
the magnitude of a star which yields a signal of 1 count (ADU) in a 1
second exposure. Initially you can use an arbitrary value but it is
useful to refine it to something close to the zeropoint of the
calibrated scale (see log output of your first photometric calibration
later on)
</dd>
<dt>ttype:</dt>
<dd>
Telescope type: L=reflector, R=refractor, A=photo lens
</dd>
<dt>ctype:</dt>
<dd>
Sensor type: CCD=monochrome CCD, DSLR=DSLR with native camera model RAW
files, CMOS=monochrome CMOS sensor, RGGB or similar pattern for a
one-shot-color CMOS sensor with a Bayer filter matrix in the given
layout (see also chapter 4.5).

<p>Save your edits and close the text editor. After any modification you
can choose if the new parameter file is just applied to your current
project or if you like to use it in subsequent new projects.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.5" id="raw-images"><span
class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Raw Images</h2>
<p>Initially the AIRTOOLS software was written to work on digital camera
raw image files. It uses a modified version of the <a
href="https://www.dechifro.org/dcraw/">dcraw</a> converter (by D.
Coffin). Therefore raw images of all cameras supported by <em>dcraw</em>
will be handled by AIRTOOLS. Later on, support of single plane FITS
images from CCD cameras was added. Now, the AIRTOOLS software correctly
handles monochrome images as well as bayered images from one-shot color
sensors (e.g. CMOS sensors with an added Bayer filter matrix).</p>
<p>At first you must copy your unprocessed raw images to the projects
raw directory within the Linux file system. There are different
solutions to handle this file transfer between the host operating system
if AIRTOOLS is running in a virtualized environment. We suggest using
the shared folder feature of the VirtualBox software:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Locate the VirtualBox menubar (above the virtual Linux Desktop)
and select Devices/Shared Folders/Shared Folder Settings</p></li>
<li><p>Click the blue folder icon in the right part of the settings
window which opens the “Add Share” dialog</p></li>
<li><p>Select the folder path of the host computer where you collect raw
images and select Auto-mount and then click OK button</p></li>
<li><p>Accept the settings for the new shared folder by using the OK
button</p></li>
<li><p>Within the virtual Linux computer start the file manager. You
will recognize the new file share in the left panel (default name starts
with “sf_”). Locate the raw image files on this file share (exported
from your host computers file system) and copy them to the raw files
folder corresponding to your current project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the instructions in the <a
href="#using-external-usb-storage">appendix</a> if your raw images
reside on an external USB disk.</p>
<p>You are now going to start the first AIRTOOLS task. By pressing the
“Extract basic image info” the program reads meta data of all raw image
files. At the end an editor window pops up which shows an overview of
relevant data for each image. Please note the column which holds a
4-digit image number associated with each image (first column if images
are in FITS format, second column if images are RAW files from DSLR).
Individual images are referenced by this number throughout the reduction
process.</p>
<p>To view an raw image or a selection of several raw images you can
open the “Misc. Tools” tab, enter the image number or a sequence into
the textfield next to the “Load Raw Images” button (e.g. 3-5,9-11) and
press the button to start, which starts the SAOImage viewer.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.6"
id="image-orientation-flip-status-and-bayer-pattern"><span
class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Image orientation, flip status
and Bayer pattern</h2>
<p>Most professional tools in astronomy are storing and displaying image
data starting at the bottom line, following general conventions provided
by the FITS specification. Unfortunately, most camera drivers nowadays
are delivering data the other way around, starting with the topmost row.
Depending on the data acquisition software and different tools for
displaying FITS images, there might be additional steps of image
flipping involved. It is therefore difficult to reliably estimate the
image orientation in a viewer program on the computer in advance, even
if we know the path of light in the optical train of our instrument.</p>
<p>In AIRTOOLS we have to provide image orientation parameters via the
camera parameters file (e.g. column “flip”) for each individual setup.
The best way to get things right is to look at an example raw FITS image
captured by your camera which contains an object with a known
orientation (e.g. Plejades or Whirlpool Galaxy). Load a raw image in the
SAOImage display application and check if the object appears
flipped/mirrored or not. This determines the value for the “flip”
parameter, using a setting of 1 if the image is flipped.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/rawfile_bayer2.png" title="rawfile_bayer2"
alt="Raw image preview (fliped image) and Bayer matrix pattern" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Raw image preview (fliped image) and
Bayer matrix pattern</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Special care must be taken when dealing with images from
one-shot-color cameras with a Bayer matrix filter. The parameter “ctype”
must be used to tell the software about the present Bayer pattern order.
We need to estimate it by examining a raw image in the SAOImage viewer.
Choose an image area void of stars, or even better an image of the
twilight sky (red and blue pixels ideally should have different
brightness). Zoom in to display about 8x8 pixels and ajust brightness
and contrast to highlight the underlaying Bayer pattern structure.
Select a pixel for which the center has x and y image coordinates close
to uneven numbers. This is the first pixel of the Bayer matrix (the
pixel to the right is the second one of the matrix, see Figure 3). If
adjacent pixels on both diagonals crossing the selected one are similar
in brightness then the first pixel of the Bayer pattern is a green one.
It is difficult to distinguish between the two possible alternatives
GBRG and GRBG but most likely it will be the first. If diagonal pixels
are varying a lot in brightness (as is the case in the example image)
then the first pixel of the pattern is either red or blue, which means
either RGGB or BGGR. Again, most likely it is the first variant. A final
decision can only be drawn when examining a de-bayered image of a known
colored target. Another possibility is to compare sky flats taken at
bright twilight and almost dark sky, because the bright twilight appears
much bluer.</p>
<p>The example image is a capture of the night sky under bright urban
light pollution, resulting in much higher intensity of red pixels than
blue ones. Pixel 1 appears much brighter than pixel 4 which means the
red pixel is the first one of the Bayer pattern and the correct entry
for “ctype” in the parameter file in this case is therefore RGGB.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.7" id="image-set-definition"><span
class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Image Set Definition</h2>
<p>An image set is a number of images of the same type and target,
e.g. a couple of dark exposures with a given exposure time or a
bracketed sequence of exposures of a comet. All image sets of the
project are described in a parameter file called <code>set.dat</code>
which must be created by yourself. From the AIRTOOLS application’s main
menu select “Edit” and “Edit Image Set Definitions”. Here is an example
of a typical file which can be used for reference:</p>
<pre><code># 230216
# Skygems Hakos, Namibia, FSQ106, Moravian C3-61000EC PRO, ts=0

# UT
# h:m set  target type texp n1 n2   nref dark flat tel

04:46 dk01 dark     d  10 0019 0030 -    -    -    SHF # ts=0
04:44 dk02 dark     d 120 0031 0042 -    -    -    SHF
18:43 co02 2017K2   o 120 0043 0047 0045 dk02 sk01 SHF # 230221
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is as follows: everything after the character
<code>#</code> is considered a comment. Each line (uncommented and
non-empty) defines an image set using at least 11 fields (words
separated by spaces) which are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>h:m:</dt>
<dd>
The local time (or UT if you prefer) at start of imaging. This is for
personel reference only and not used at all by the program.
</dd>
<dt>set:</dt>
<dd>
The name given to the image set. We do recommend the following scheme:
Use the first two letters to denote the image type, where “dk” is for
darks (and bias exposures) and “sk” for sky flats, “co” might be used
for a comet observation. Any other deep sky target could use two (or
three) letters from the constellation it belongs to. After the letters
use a two-digit running number, so the image set of the first comet
target would be named <code>co01</code>, the second <code>co02</code>
and so on. The set name is used in many places later on, e.g. in the
file names of computed stacks and other result files. Therefore a short
name using four characters only is recommended.
</dd>
<dt>target:</dt>
<dd>
Short name of the target observed (up to 8 characters). For comets a
compact name has to be used, e.g. 2017K2 is recognized as C/2017 K2
(PANSTARRS).
</dd>
<dt>type:</dt>
<dd>
Type of images (1 character): d=dark/bias, f=flat, o=lights, a=addition
(continuation) of a previously defined image set. If you for some reason
would like to exclude a series of images from the analysis (e.g. a focus
sequence) but keep the information about those files for your record
then use the character <code>-</code> in place of the image type.
</dd>
<dt>texp:</dt>
<dd>
Exposure time of a single exposure in seconds.
</dd>
<dt>n1:</dt>
<dd>
Number of the first image of the set.
</dd>
<dt>n2:</dt>
<dd>
Number of the last image of the set.
</dd>
<dt>nref:</dt>
<dd>
Number of the image which is used as a reference image for stacking,
typically it should be close to the middle of the bracketed sequence.
Not used for darks and flats.
</dd>
<dt>dark:</dt>
<dd>
Name of the master dark (image set name) used for calibration.
</dd>
<dt>flat:</dt>
<dd>
Name of the master flat used for calibration.
</dd>
<dt>tel:</dt>
<dd>
Identifier of the instrument (telescope/camera) used. This must match a
valid entry in <code>camera.dat</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A note about master calibration images. It is not required and not
convenient to capture darks and flats in every night. After you have
collected some calibration sets and build some master files by AIRTOOLS
it is common practice to reuse them later on. This can be done by simply
copying them over from older project directories to the current one
using the file manager.</p>
<p>Some (remote) observatories deliver already calibrated images to
their customers. In this special case you can omit dark and flat field
calibration by providing the name “cal” for both dark and flat field
image names.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="image-reduction"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Image Reduction</h1>
<p>The “Image Reduction” tab is the first tab of the AIRTOOLS graphical
user interface. Its main purpose is to provide general tasks for basic
reduction of astronomical images that is to process all of the raw image
sequences to obtain deep stacked result images of your targets.</p>
<p>The tasks are presented in logical order and may be run one step
after the other - which is recommended for first time users - or run
completely unattended, including astrometry and blind stacking on a
moving comet. Just select the tasks you wish to run in a row. Suitable
parameters are determined automatically and will work in most cases.</p>
<p>It is possible to limit the requested tasks to run on a specific
image set (or a list of image sets) by providing the set name in the
appropriate text entry field.</p>
<p>The final group of checkboxes determines which part of the tasks is
executed. Normally, you will want the program to process your images and
display any diagnostic plot it creates and show all result images. Image
processing is normally applied to unprocessed image sets only. You might
use the checkbox “Delete previous results” if you need to re-run a
specific task and overwrite previously generated data (for safety reason
you need to provide the desired image set names explicitely).</p>
<p>Pressing the “Start” button causes the selected tasks to execute. At
any time you may interrupt operation by pressing the same button again.
Note that interruption is typically defered by a couple of seconds.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.1" id="master-darks-and-flats"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Master Darks and Flats</h2>
<p>The processing of calibration images involves a mixture of median and
average operations. For best results it is therefore adviced to capture
multiples of 6 exposures, e.g. 6 individual dark images at any required
exposure time (and temperature) and 12 individual flat images for each
filter used.</p>
<p>Throughout this manual we refer to the term master dark by meaning of
an image which has not been subtracted by a bias image. Within this
definition a bias image is just a dark image at zero seconds exposure
time. Furthermore a master flat image is a dark-subtracted flat field
(where the corresponding master dark was taken at the same exposure
time, sometimes called a flat-dark).</p>
<p>If you don’t know your camera/sensor very well then it is a good idea
to take more exposures - especially darks. The processing routines
include measurements of the dark level in each image. A plot of this
measurements is displayed and you can evaluate the stability of the mean
intensity level. In addition, the difference of each individual dark
exposure with respect to the mean image is computed. A mosaic of the
much downsized and contrast enhanced difference images is created and
displayed. This is helpful again to judge sensor stability and health.
You may measure image intensity withing self defined regions. Note that
the mean intensity of difference images has been shifted to 1000 and
streched by a factor of 10.</p>
<p>The number of individual flat images has to be choosen to be large
enough to provide suitable signal to noise (not degrade the signal to
noise of the stacked target image). Also its intensity level should be
choosen carefully to provide high signal but fall well within linear
range of the sensor response. Creating high quality flat fields is a
challenge but crucial for obtaining precise photometry of extended
objects like comets.</p>

<p>TODO</p>
<h2 data-number="5.3" id="image-calibration"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Image Calibration</h2>
<p>Image calibration involves the subtraction of the master dark image
and division by the master flat image. The calibrated images are stored
in the temporary directory defined for the project. Their name starts
with the image number associated with each individual raw image.
Calibrated images are not overwritten by default and kept throughout the
project.</p>
<p>There is no plots or result images produced by the caibration task.
Though you may display certain calibrated images by using actions from
the “Misc. Tools” tab: enter an image set name or specific image numbers
and press the button “Load Calibrated Images”.</p>
<p>For DSLR images it is possible to provide a text file which holds a
list of known hot pixels. Those will be replaced by the interpolation
algorithm during the debayering step. The hot pixel file must be named
using a fixed scheme which uses the camera name you have defined in the
parameter file <code>camera.dat</code>. The appropriate line is found by
matching the telescope identifier of the image set (first column in
<code>camera.dat</code>). The camera name is given at fifth field
position of that line. If the camera identifier is <code>K5II</code>
then you have to name the hot pixel file <code>hotpix.k5ii.dat</code>
and place it in the project directory. The file contains one line per
pixel, with at least 3 space separated values. The values are image
coordinates in x (starting at left with 0) and y (starting at top with
0) and a third fixed value of 0.</p>
<p>In addition it is possible to manually create masks of bad image
regions where necessary (e.g. satellite trails) on calibrated images.
Load the calibrated images and use SAOImage regions to draw around
affected areas. Save the regions file under the <code>bgvar</code>
subdirectory using a name containing the given image number,
e.g. <code>0003.bad.reg</code>. Those image regions will be excluded
from the stacking process later on.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.4" id="background-evaluation"><span
class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Background evaluation</h2>
<p>Often, observations are carried out under non-perfect conditions. If
you plan to estimate photometric magnitudes from extended sources, then
it is important to carefully check image quality and possibly reject
some exposures from stacking of a long sequence of images. Therefore a
check of variation in the sky background has been added to the
processing pipeline. At first, a downsized background map is created for
each image and the average intensity level is plotted.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/gsog.bg.png" title="Background intensity"
alt="Background intensity (3 image sets)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Background intensity (3 image
sets)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then an average background image is created for each image set as
reference and difference images are created for each individual
exposure. A mosaic of those thumbnail difference images is finally
displayed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/bgvar.png" title="Background variation"
alt="Background variation (2 different image sets)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Background variation (2 different image
sets)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 data-number="5.5" id="image-registration"><span
class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Image Registration</h2>
<p>The stacking process involves several steps. At first, sources
(stars) are extracted for each calibrated image. Then sources are
matched with respect to the reference image of the given set. Some of
the brighter, unsaturated stars are used to measure relative brightness
between images and an average value of star size (full width at half
maximum). Those values are plotted to allow to quantify image quality
and sky conditions.</p>
<p>If some of your images have signs of much degraded quality then you
might wish to exclude them from any further processing. To do so, go to
the “Edit” menu and open the “Project Settings”. Add the corresponding
image numbers to the string variable <code>AI_EXCLUDE</code> (space
separated four digit numbers). Save your edits and close the text
editor.</p>

<p>Finally the images are projected to the reference image arbitrary
coordinate system and co-added. The stacked image is used to create an
object catalog. Stellar sources of this catalog are matched against a
local copy of the Tycho2 star catalog to obtain a first astrometric
solution (using an offline Astrometry.net solver). In a second step a
global model is fitted (using online UCAC-4 catalog) over the whole
image including to map some degree of distortion. This new WCS model is
saved and used later on to identify objects from photometric catalogs.
The overall astrometric accuracy is printed to the log output and
several diagnostic plots are created to show residuals from catalog
position in different axes, a distortion map showing pixel scale
variation and a sky chart with detected sources.</p>

<p>With the help of the astrometric solution and comet ephemeris data
fetched from MPC it is possible to predict the comet motion between
individual exposures and use this information to do blind stacking on
the comet.</p>
<p>The resulting output images have names starting with the image set
name. Stacks centered on the moving comet have a fixed string suffix of
<code>_m</code> after the set name. Images consist of 16bit integer data
and are either in PGM (monochrome, gray image) or PPM (RGB color image)
format. The choice of these formats over FITS is mainly due to historic
reasons - the software originally was written to reduce DSLR images only
- and because many of the underlying image reduction software programs
simply do not operate on (RGB-) FITS images. Image metadata are stored
in associated ASCII header files using the file extension
<code>.head</code>.</p>

id="setup-of-a-virtual-machine-for-the-linux-os"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Setup of a Virtual Machine
for the Linux OS</h3>
<p>At first you need to install the VirtualBox software as described in
<a href="#installing-oracle-virtualbox">this chapter</a>.</p>
<p>Start the Oracle VirtualBox Manager, if not running already. Click on
the “New” button and fill in the name of the new VM, e.g. xubuntu-vm.
Depending on the name you have choosen you might have to select
Type=“Linux” and Version=“Ubuntu (64-bit)”. Continue by pressing
“Next”.</p>
<p>Set the memory size to &gt;=2 GB (recommended 4 GB or up to 75% of
physical RAM) and press “Next”.</p>
<p>Create a virtual hard disk of type VDI of fixed size. You can use the
proposed location but it is recommended to create the virtual disk file
on a fast physical hard disk drive, e.g. SSD. The file size should be
&gt;=50 GB to serve for roughly 10-20 comet observations, based on 10-20
individual exposures each. If you intent to use the AIRTOOLS software
regularly to analyze all your comet observations then you should create
a much larger virtual hard disk. After pressing the “Create” button the
virtual machine is created.</p>
<p>It is recommended to tweak some additional parameters for improved
performance. Click the “Settings” button to access the following
tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tab System/Processor: increase number of CPU to &gt;=2 (up to number
of physical cores)</li>
<li>Tab Display/Screen: increase Memory to 64 MB</li>
<li>Tab USB: choose USB 3.0 Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally you should create a desktop icon to directly launch the
virtual machine. Locate the name of the virtual machine on the left side
of the VirtualBox Manager, press the right mouse and select “Create
Shortcut on Desktop”.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.1.2"
id="booting-install-medium-of-the-xubuntu-linux-distribution"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Booting Install Medium of the
Xubuntu Linux distribution</h3>
<p>Download the ISO image file of the latest Xubuntu LTS release from <a
href="http://xubuntu.org/download"
class="uri">http://xubuntu.org/download</a>. Please note the important
<strong>LTS</strong> version label, which indicates a “Long Term
Support” release. This Linux OS version is well supported by the
AIRTOOLS software. Choose a mirror download close to your location and
download the 64-bit desktop image. At the time of this writing it is
named <code>xubuntu-22.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso</code>.</p>
<p>The ISO image file is used in place of a install medium for the
virtual machine. To do so you have to start the VirtualBox software (if
not running already) and press the “Settings” button of the selected
virtual machine.</p>
<p>Select the “Storage” tab. Within “Storage Devices” click on the CD
symbol (labeled “Empty”) and from “Attributes” click the CD symbol near
the right border of the window and select the previously downloaded ISO
file. Pressing “OK” will save your modified settings and you are ready
to start the virtual machine by pressing the green “Start” button.</p>
<p>The following boot process is very similar to a regular boot process
of a install CD/DVD on a real computer. In addition, the current virtual
machine can be used to start a fully functional Linux live session to
evaluate or experiment with the Xubuntu Linux OS (but this is not our
goal).</p>
<h3 data-number="7.1.3" id="installing-xubuntu-linux"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> Installing Xubuntu Linux</h3>
<p>Now, the Linux OS has to be installed into the presently empty
virtual hard disk of the running virtual machine. Please make sure your
host computer has a working internet connection.</p>
<p>From the initial “Welcome” screen you choose your prefered language
and click the “Install Xubuntu” button to start the setup program of the
installer. You can accept default settings on all the following screens
(“Keyboard layout”, “Updates and other software”, “Installation type”).
Please note that the Linux OS is installed on the virtual hard disk
only, it does in no way erase data from your host computer’s file
system. Finally click “Install now” and confirm writing the changes to
the (virtual) disk by the “Continue” button.</p>
<p>While the installation process has already started in the background
you are asked to provide a few additional informations:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Where are you”: Select your time zone by clicking close to your
geographic location</li>
<li>“Who are you”: Fill in your (full) name, a computer name, username
and user password. Note that choosing “xubuntu” for the name of the
virtual computer is allowed, despite the given warning message. You
might toggle the “Log in automatically” radio button for the sake of
convenience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue the installation process which will take a few minutes to
complete. Finally you are asked to restart the (virtual) computer. This
will take a little time and you might be prompted to remove the
installation medium (the ISO file used in the virtual CDROM drive).
Press the “Enter” key to continue. There are few combinations of host
hardware, VirtualBox version and guest operating system where the
virtual machine is not rebooting but showing a black screen for infinite
time. In this case you must manually close the virtual machine window
and select “Shutdown VM”. In the VirtualBox Manager, check that the ISO
file is removed from the virtual CDROM drive and start the virtual
machine again.</p>
<p>The virtual machine (in virtualbox jargon the “guest” system) will
now boot the installed Linux OS from the virtual disk and automatically
logs in to the Xubuntu Linux desktop. Please note the different sections
of the VirtualBox guest application window: the VirtualBox guest
machine’s menu bar at the top, a status bar at the bottom and the
virtual screen of the Linux Desktop in between.</p>
<p>After booting into the virtual Xubuntu Linux desktop you might be
faced by a message window stating “Incomplete Language Support”. It is
save to skip the update until later as it is not required by the
AIRTOOLS software installation.</p>
<p>Similarly the “Software Updater” might pop up at any time with the
information about available updates of currently installed packages.
Again, those updates are not required right now but should be completed
after the AIRTOOLS installation.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.1.4" id="xubuntu-desktop-basics-1"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1.4</span> Xubuntu Desktop Basics</h3>
<p>See <a href="#xubuntu-desktop-basics">this chapter</a>. Please note
that the appearance of the desktop might be slightly different from that
of the pre-build Linux appliance, e.g. the panel applet for choosing
another keyboard language is not visible.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.1.5" id="installing-virtualbox-guest-additions"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1.5</span> Installing VirtualBox Guest
Additions</h3>
<p>The Guest Additions are designed to be installed inside a virtual
machine after the guest operating system has been installed. They
consist of device drivers and system applications provided by Oracle
VirtualBox that optimize the guest operating system for better
performance and usability.</p>
<p>For installation you must</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot the guest OS.</li>
<li>Go to the VirtualBox guest menu item “Devices” and press “Install
Guest Additions CD Image”. A new CD icon appears on the Linux desktop
and a few seconds later the Linux file manager is showing the contents
of the Guest Additions virtual CD.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window using “File” menu of the file manager and
select “Open Terminal Here”.</li>
<li>From the command line of the terminal run the following commands
(you will be asked to provide your password):
<code>sudo apt-get update</code> and
<code>sudo apt-get install build-essential</code></li>
<li>Start installation by entering the command:
<code>sudo bash VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code></li>
<li>If installation has finished close the terminal window and eject the
virtual CD by using the eject button (caret-up) next to the CD entry in
the file manager.</li>
<li>Finally you must reboot the Linux guest.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a restart of the Linux virtual machine you may adjust the guest
window size and effectively the screen size of the Linux desktop as
needed.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can now configure the virtual machine to use a shared
clipboard between host and guest and use drag-and-drop between both
systems. Those settings are activated from the “Devices” menu of the
VirtualBox guest menu bar on the top of the window.</p>

“Devices” menu entry on the VirtualBox VM menu at the top of the window.
Select “USB” and you will see a list of USB devices from which you need
to identify and select the USB disk. After a few seconds a new USB disk
icon will apear on the virtual Linux desktop and little after the file
manager window pops up. Use the common copy-and-paste feature to copy
files between the Linux file system and USB device.</p>
<p>After the file transfer has finished you can disconnect the USB
device by pushing the eject button next to the USB device entry of the
